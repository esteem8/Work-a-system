# Work a system

Framework to work a system.

### Introduction

**A system is what make it does what it perform.**

### Words explanation

* **A system** is a composition of nested systems composed of functions.
* **A function** is a composition of process.
* **A process** is a series of mechanical or chemical operations.

-

* **A [definition](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/tree/master/definition)** is a representation of a system composed by informations.
* **A [strategies](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/tree/master/strategies)** is a series of high level process in order to perform something.
* **A [principle](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/tree/master/principles)** is a guideline composed by informations.

### Framework composition

* **Define "what ?"**
  * [System composition **definition**](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/blob/master/definition/system%20composition%20definition.md) *(to know how to optimize the system)*
  * [System objectives **definition**](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/blob/master/definition/system%20objectives%20definition.md) *(to know what the system need to accomplish)*
* **Define "how ?"**
  * [System optimization **strategies**](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/tree/master/strategies/optimization) *(to optimize the system composition)*
  * [System objectives **strategies**](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/tree/master/strategies/objectives) *(to accomplish system objectives)*
* **Define with these**
  * [Define system **principles**](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/blob/master/principles/define%20system%20principles.md) *(to define the system composition and objectives)*
  * [Make strategy **principles**](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/blob/master/principles/make%20strategy%20principles.md) *(to make strategies)*
  * [Organize strategies **principles**](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/blob/master/principles/organize%20strategies%20principles) *(to sequences and detail strategies parts)*
  * [Process **principles**](https://github.com/Primerz/Work-a-system/blob/master/principles/process%20principles.md) *(to process organized strategies)*
