# Make strategy principles

* Think freshly from scratch with an effort-and-actual-parameters conscious mindset.
* Focus on sustainable effort management, reduction and investment.
* Strategies are realist and composed of nested directives.
* Directives need to be adequately precise and divided along the entire process.
